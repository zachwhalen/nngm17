# The House(s) that ConceptNet Built

This project is a children's book generated by walking through related nouns and verbs in [ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io), with illustrations from (The Noun Project)[http://thenounproject.com]. The structure is based on the classic nursery rhyme, "(The House that Jack built)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_the_House_That_Jack_Built]," with quite a few permutations.

The core idea is relatively simple, even though it took me a few weeks of trial and error to implement it: the code builds chains of concepts of whatever length that end in "house". Once I figured out how to generate those chains, I found that 7 chains of 55 concepts each (chapters) would get me over 50,000 words, so then I had to figure out how to illustrate it. 

If for some reason you want to run this yourself, you'll need quite a few Python modules:
I think most are pretty standard, but a few that are not may be `requests`, `textblob`, `pattern.en`, `glob`, `flickrapi`, `weasyprint`, and `pycorpora`.

You'll also need a file called "credentials" formatted like this:

```
flickr_key = {yours goes here}
flickr_secret = {yours goes here}
noun_key = {yours goes here}
noun_secret = {yours goes here}
```

And you'll need these directories for all of the page and pdf generation: 

 - `pages/`
 - `icons/`
 - `images/`
 - `pdfs/`
